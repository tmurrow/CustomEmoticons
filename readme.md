# Custom Jabber Emoticons
_Custom emoticons (made by me) for a few of my co-workers to use in Jabber, along with some common memes and gifs we like to use. Please don't use my artwork without my permission!_
## Instructions
- Clone this repository to:
 - `C:\Program Files (x86)\Cisco Systems\Cisco Jabber` (delete your CustomEmoticons folder first)
 - Or wherever you like, but you'll have to copy everything to either `...\Cisco Jabber\Emoticons` or `...\Cisco Jabber\CustomEmoticons` manually each time you pull
- **Update** Either delete or move everything in the `...\Cisco Jabber\Emoticons` folder
- Restart Jabber
- Enjoy!

### Optional steps
I've included a program to sort the xml file so that certain emoticons can show up at the top of the emoticon selection box in Jabber, for easier/faster picking. If you'd like to sort your emoticons, follow these steps:
- Run `OrganizeEmoticons.exe`
 - The program makes a backup of your file each time it's run, so you can revert to the previous version for whatever reason
- According to the prompt, choose which set you want at the top
- Restart Jabber
- Enjoy!

_Note: If you want to keep them organized, you'll probably have to organize after each pull_
