# Custom Jabber Emoticons
- Clone this repository to:
 - `C:\Program Files (x86)\Cisco Systems\Cisco Jabber` (delete your CustomEmoticons folder first)
 - Or wherever you like, but you'll have to copy everything to either `...\Cisco Jabber\Emoticons` or `...\Cisco Jabber\CustomEmoticons` manually each time you pull
- Restart Jabber
- Enjoy!

### Optional steps
I've included a program to sort the xml file so that your emoticons can show up at the top, for easier selecting in the emoticon picker box. If you'd like to sort your emoticons, follow these steps:
- Run `OrganizeEmoticons.exe`
- Enter the name of the file you wish to sort (`emoticonDefs.xml`)
 - The program makes a backup of your file each time it's run, so you can revert to the previous version for whatever reason
- According to the prompt, enter the first letter or two of your name
 - If your name is not included, let me know and I'll add it!
- Restart Jabber
- Enjoy!

_Note: If you want to keep them organized, you'll probably have to organize after each pull_
